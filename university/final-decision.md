Making a final decision isn't easy. When determining which school you want to commit to, look past the rankings.

For example, if you're interested in computer science programs, ask the following questions regardless of the school's prestige:
* What type of research can I do here? How easy is it to get a research position?
* What are the professors here famous for? Systems? Distributed Systems? HCI? Algorithms?
* What are the required courses for a CE degree? What electives are there? How much choice do I have when deciding on classes?
* What are the people like?
* Where do most of the graduates end up?
* Scholarship opportunities?
* What companies recruit here? How do they treat the students?
