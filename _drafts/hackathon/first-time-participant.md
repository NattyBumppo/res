Advice from friends, Hackathon Hackers, and the internet.

###Preparing
* Setup your development environment before arriving. This includes:
  * IDEs/Editors/Plugins
  * APIs
  * Libraries
* Understand the basics of at least one form of version control. Using Git via [GitHub](https://github.com/) is an excellent place to start.
* Read up on relevant technologies you hope to include. If the event is sponsored by a company, familiarize yourself with their products in particular.
* Dress comfortably.
* If possible, form a team beforehand and brainstorm potential ideas so that you can hit the ground running.

###Networking
* Break from your code throughout the hackathon to network with other developers (employees, mentors, students).
* You don't need to be an expert on a company's product, but at least having some general knowlege or pre-constructed questions can help to get a dialogue going.
* Be humble when discussing your accomplishments.
* Show enthusiasm in your work and genuine interest in theirs.
* Don't burn any bridges, you will likely see some of these participants/organizers again.

###Presenting
* Have something completed. It may not look like your initial design but having something working shows determination and perseverance.
* Explain the high-level details of your project:
  * What does it do?
  * What technologies did you integrate?
  * Demo in a clear and organized fashion.
* Discuss the audience for your product and how this product will improve their current circumstances.
* Have an idea for future enhancements. You may never intend to work on this again, but it's often good to be prepared when this question is inevitably asked.

###General Wisdom
* Don't underestimate yourself.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Hackathons are an excellent way to learn in a short period of time!
* Enjoy the atmosphere.
* Commit to an idea and go for it.
* Set realistic expectations for your project. You can always add more features if time permits but it's always better to start small and envision your demo as you progress.
