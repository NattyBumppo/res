### Building Permit
All UW CSE community members have a building permit. Anyone who is in the building during closed hours should be ready to show their CSE building permit (separate from husky card) to the security guards that roam the building. If you're with someone who has a building permit, it's fine.

Contact the advisors if you think you should have a building permit but don't.
