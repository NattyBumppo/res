Things people wish they knew when they were first admitted into CSE.

* 
* How going to the labs with the express intention of *not* getting any work done is often more valuable than going to section. The people you meet in the labs are your professional, academic, and personal network, and you should build that group. 

Also, if you see people giving you dirty looks in 002 that means reel it in a bit and shut up for a while. 

Also my whole thing about confirmation bias which I really don't want to to type out a again.

You don't have to go to 002. 022 and 006 exist.

Everyone's awesome and nice and helpful, but you have to be brave enough to talk to them to find that out.

How awesome everyone is. I didn't really hang out with anyone in CSE for a couple of quarters, which is unfortunate in retrospect.
