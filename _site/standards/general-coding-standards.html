            <p>We enforce these while reviewing code from teammates' commits. It is up to the code reviewer to make any style fixes before signing off on a certain commit. Github allows us to make comments, which will ensure that we can easily communicate about any problems with code styles.</p>

<h3>Code Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nontrivial code should be made on a separate branch and pushed to origin.</li>
<li>Before merging to master, the merger role should be assigned to whichever teammate seems most appropriate for the particular change.</li>
<li>Request a code review</li>
<li>Push your branch to origin</li>
<li>Open an issue (label: code review), assign a reviewer, make any comments</li>
<li>Mention branch name &amp; any notable commits on that branch</li>
<li>A code reviewer will evaluate and comment the code for style, as well as for algorithmic efficiency, comments, and overall structure.</li>
<li>It is up to a code reviewer to make any changes before merging a branch into master. The changes the code reviewer makes should be discussed with, or at least made known to, the original coder before merging into master.</li>
<li>A code reviewer will leave any information of interest in a comment of the issue before closing the issue.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Issue Documentation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Creating a new issue</li>
<li>Each issue should include a full description of what the issue refers to.</li>
<li>Bugs should include full repro steps, including OS and browser.</li>
<li><p>Assign the issue to the person who is most likely the most efficient person to resolve an issue, to yourself, or leave it up for grabs.</p></li>
<li><p>Updating an issue</p></li>
<li>If working on a bug fix or new feature, comment with use cases, expected working features, and known problems that are in progress</li>
<li><p>Comment with relevant questions or comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Closing an issue</p></li>
<li>After completing a task, write a comment if needed.</li>
<li><p>Include relevant commit hashes, if applicable</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate issues</p></li>
<li>Choose one issue to close (usually less conversation or less details in the description)</li>
<li><p>Reference the duplicate issue in the issue to close so they&rsquo;re linked</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning issues</p></li>
<li>If an issue is not assigned to anyone, feel free to grab the issue. Alternatively, assign the issue to someone who is knowledgeable in that area.</li>
<li>If an issue is already assigned to someone, do not change the assignment unless there is a mutual agreement.</li>
<li>If an issue is assigned to someone, do NOT complete the task/fix the issue without talking to the assignee.</li>
</ul>
