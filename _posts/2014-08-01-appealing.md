## University of Washington Freshman Appeal Guide
Originally published April 2010  

It's your senior year. You've had your eyes on the University of Washington for some time now, and it's very disappointing that you were waitlisted or rejected. But wait... it's not the end, yet. You're not about to give up. You plan to appeal the admission decision.  

It won't be an easy process. In fact, you're going to have to face yourself honestly to even start wriing a convincing appeal. Through all the pain, sweat, and tears, the chances of a successful appeal are slim. But when the appeal is successful, your educational path will change. Your life will change. And you may cry tears of joy.  

So what do you do? What do you need to do to create an amazing appeal to show the admissions officer that you bleed purple and gold?  

### Steps:
* Get a copy of your UW application
* Put together a strong appeal package
  * Appeal letter (required)
  * Transcript (required)
  * Recommendation letters
  * Resume/activities sheet
* Enroll at another school
* Send your appeal
* Wait

### Get a copy of your UW application
This will be very helpful. When you applied in the fall, you may have felt like your application was flawless. Obviously, this was not the case. The best thing now is to figure out what your weaknesses were on the application. Was it your essays? Perhaps your extra-curricular activities and awards seem to be too cliché or you didn't put much thought into them. Maybe your GPA and test scores took a toll on your application.  

Whatever the case, we need to figure out what you need to highlight in your appeal letter. If it was your essay, let's figure out how to send a stronger message to the admissions committee. If it was your extra-curricular activities, let's figure out what you've done so far senior year or how we could add to the information you provided to the admissions office. Was it your GPA or test scores? You can't do much about it, but were there special circumstances surrounding low grades? In your appeal, can you convince the admissions committee that you aren't a stereotypical, “low GPA, lazy student”?  

Let's figure out how to determine what your weaknesses were on the application. Have your college counselor look through the application. He or she probably has a good idea of what colleges are looking for – more than your parents, teachers, or friends. Next, have your parents look through the application. Perhaps they have some pointers they can give you. By now, you should see some sort of pattern emerge – perhaps you, your counselor, and your parents agree that you should have used a less overconfident, pompous voice in your essay. If you want, have a trusted, close friend read through parts of your application and get an opinion from him or her.  

Basically, once you have a copy of your submitted application, you are already a step up ahead of other students – some will submit appeals without ever reviewing their application and make the exact same mistake in the appeal.  

You can contact the admissions office here to request a copy of your application:

Address: Room 320 Schmitz Hall – 1410 NE Campus Parkway  
```

### Put together a strong appeal package.
When you send in an appeal to the University of Washington, it's pointless to just write:

```
Dear admissions officers,
  I am appealing your decision to reject me.

Sincerely,
  John Doe
```

The office will probably toss this aside. You're not giving them any more information that can support your admittance to the university. There are a few basic items you should include in your appeal package: appeal letter, a resume, recommendations, and your high school transcript. In the following paragraphs, I'll go over why each item is important and what how to prepare each component.

#### Appeal Letter
The appeal is ‘preferably typed’ and must not exceed 3 pages. Look at your application (assuming you now have access) and be prepared to answer these questions. The prompts were taking straight off the admissions website.

* Why do you think you are an excellent candidate for the Seattle campus of the University of Washington?
* Why do you believe you need to be at the Seattle campus of the University of Washington? Why at this time?
* If your overall academic record is not as strong as it could be, why do you think it is a poor predictor of your future performance? Explain your academic record fully and tell us how you plan to be a successful student at the UW. Your explanation might include (but is not limited to) a discussion of circumstances and hardships, such as personal or family illness, factors related to a disability, or familial or cultural barriers that may have affected your academic performance and record.
* If you are inadmissible because you have not completed all of the college academic distribution requirements (as explained in your denial letter), why were you unable to satisfy these requirements? How do you plan to complete this course work once enrolled at the UW?

This appeal letter is so, so, so important. Don't mess it up. Try to figure out what you want to talk about and how you want to talk about it. It could be a story about your past, your vision for your future, or a combination. It should be something unique to you.

Have an English teacher read through your appeal, as well as your counselor. Remember, quality over quantity.

#### Resume
A resume!? What if I don’t have one? Never fear! Remember those five activities you wrote about for UW? That's already pretty much starting your 'resume.' You don't have to necessarily submit a resume-format list of extra-curricular activities. For the sake of this package, I will be referring to the 'activities list' as a resume.

Since you (theoretically) have received a copy of your application check out what you wrote for your five activities. What have you done since the time of your application? Did you leave out any leadership positions or awards? Have you started a project since then? What other awards have you received?

This is your place to boast. Yep, boast. Throw yourself at the admissions office. Why are you super amazing, and what have you done to back that up? This is your place to shine.

#### Transcript
Oh dear. Grades. Hopefully you haven't had a disastrous dip in GPA since the beginning of senior year. A lot of brownie points in appealing comes from your senior year grades. Have you kept them up? Grab a copy of your high school transcript from the registrar or college counselor and include it.

It's required to send an updated, official transcript. If you took college classes, include this as well.

#### Recommendation Letters
Recommendations must be with the appeal package when the admissions office
receives your appeal.

For general admissions, the University of Washington did not accept letters of recommendation. However, you can go ahead and ask for some now. In fact, before you even start thinking about that appeal letter, which should take up the majority of your effort, figure out who you want to write your recommendations and let them know as soon as possible. They also have pretty busy lives (most of the time, anyway) so expect them to take some time before completely finishing the recommendation letter.

If you know exactly who you want to write your letters, perfect.

If you have never asked anyone for a recommendation, here is how you go about choosing someone. Find someone who knows you. Not just from inside the classroom, such as a teacher, but past classroom expectations. This could be a softball coach, your math teacher who also happens to be the Mathletes Team advisor, or even your college counselor. Try not to choose someone who is blood related.

Before you choose someone to be a recommender, ask yourself a few questions.
* I may know this person well, but how well does he or she know me?
* If I ask him or her for a recommendation, how confident am I that he or she will be able to write a suitable recommendation?
* How did I meet this person, and how have I grown to know him or her?
* Does he or she recognize my ability to X or talents in X?
* Can this person communicate efficiently to the university admissions department why UW needs me, and why I need UW?
* Why do I want this person to write my recommendation?

Depending on who you narrow down on your choice of recommenders, you should have between 2-3 letters of recommendation. More than that may seem that you are 'trying too hard' or that some of your recommenders only know you in one aspect, and thus cannot show the admissions office how dynamic you can be.

### Enroll at another school
Yeah. Your heart is with the Huskies… but what if your appeal is not successful? You need a school to fall back on. Maybe it's a small, local private school. Maybe it's a community college. You probably will have to deposit around $200-$500 to confirm your enrollment at the school. If you end up going to University of Washington, you'll lose this deposit, but it's worth it.

Make sure you respond to colleges by May 1st!

### Send the appeal
There are a few guidelines on how to format your appeal.

First, make sure to include your signature. Then, write “Attn: AC Petition” in the lower left corner of your appeal envelope. Remember to include your information (name, address, quarter/year of application, and “freshman applicant”). You have two ways to send the appeal to the admissions office – mail or in person.

```
University of Washington
Office of Admissions
1410 NE Campus Parkway
Box 355852
Seattle, WA 98195-5852
```

If you wish to bring it in person, go to room 320 at Schmitz Hall (1410 NE Campus Parkway, Seattle) anytime from Monday through Friday from 10:30am to 5pm.

### Wait
Okay. We've sent in the appeal. There's nothing more we can do except to wait. Finish your senior year off strong – if you haven't heard back from UW admissions on your appeal by the time you graduate, send them a new copy of your transcript; this one will have your second semester grades finalized.

You should learn about the appeal decision within 3 weeks of the admissions office receiving it. If your appeal is unsuccessful, you will hear back by the end of June on an official waitlist decision.

Good luck.
