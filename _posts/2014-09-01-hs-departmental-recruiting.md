FAQ from direct admit and general high school recruiting.

### What should I look for?
I recommend students ask a number of questions when determining which school to go commit to:

* What are the professors here famous for? Systems? Distributed Systems? HCI? Algorithms?
* What type of research can I do here? How easy is it to get a research position?
* What are the required courses for a CE degree? What electives are there? How much choice do I have when deciding on classes?
* What are the people like?
* Where do most of the graduates end up?
* Scholarship opportunities?
* What companies recruit here? How do they treat the students?

### What are the CSE professors here famous for?
You can see a list of our faculty [here](http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/). We also have a variety of [research labs](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/).

I'm trying to pinpoint only a few specific areas of computer science that we're strong at, but I honestly can't rank one field above another. Going off of the research link, I can think of at least one or two professors (+PhD students) that I know who excel in their respective fields. Many submit award winning papers and are known worldwide. 

A list of fields include:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Big Data
* Computational & Synthetic Biology
* Computer Architecture
* Computer Graphics, Vision, Animation, and Game Science
* Computing for Development
* Data Management
* Human Computer Interaction
* Machine Learning
* Programming Languages and Software Engineering
* Robotics
* Security and Privacy
* Sensor Systems
* Systems and Networking
* Theory of Computation
* Ubiquitous Computing

### What type of research can I do here? How easy is it to get a research position?
See my previous answer for a list of most of our research labs. You can join any of those research labs! You can also do research for other departments, like biology; having a CSE background is extremely valuable in all fields. For example, my friend, who is a biochem/cs double major, spends his time dealing with proteins.

Many of the research groups look for research assistants/students who are freshmen or sophomores. It usually takes about a quarter (10 weeks) to ramp up a student. Then, they try to retain the students for as long as possible.

Some research labs require some knowledge, whether self-taught or through related courses. Many do an informal interview with students who want to join a lab to see what their interests are, their future goals, and how they could be an active contributor as a research student.

You can do research for credits (e.g. instead of taking a course) or as a paid position. A number of students will publish papers as contributors as undergrads.

The ACM Chapter hosts Research Night every Fall and Spring. It's a way for research students, faculty, and undergraduate students to connect and see what opportunities are available.

### What are the required courses for a CS/CE degree? What electives are there? How much choice do I have when deciding on classes?
There are slightly different degree requirements for CS and CE degrees, although the fundamentals are the same.

You can find all of the courses and elective listings here:

* [General information](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/ugrad/degree_requirements/)
* [Course offerings](https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses)

After a set of required courses (e.g. Fundamentals I&II, data abstractions), you have a choice of what type of classes you want to take. Some classes, like Systems, open up different upper division courses (e.g. Operating Systems, Networks).

CE students take more physics and there's at least an electrical engineering classes that are required. CE students are also required to take a capstone. CS students can choose between a capstone and another upper division course.

We don't have official "specializations", but we have the flexibility of classes to take. There are also a number of seminars run by the faculty, which span anything from computational biology to networks to intellectual property law. If you're interested in more design/UX type courses, you can take some INFO/HCDE/DESIGN courses in lieu of 400-level CSE classes.

### What are the people like?
When people ask me what sets UW CSE apart from other departments, I've gone back to talking about the people again and again. While you can have similar courses, research labs, and companies vying for your attention, the people make this department a community. For many students, including myself, the building becomes home away from home, and the people, my second family.

The 'people' generally fall into three categories: faculty, staff/administration, and students.

The faculty and staff are very invested in seeing their students succeed. While some are busier than others (e.g. conferences, research) I've had a great experience with both my professors and advisors. If they're doors are open, people are very open to talking about anything: assignments, research, the latest technology, etc. Unless they're stressed out or busy, faculty and staff will smile and wave at you when walking down the halls, talk to you in the elevators or while waiting for coffee, and some drop by the undergraduate labs to check on students. There's a very open culture in both connections and information.

The advisors try their best to help you out; if you're having a tough quarter, they try to work something out. If you have questions about course loads or your four year plan, they're there to help. They have drop in hours for CSE majors only, as well as general advising hours for any student who want to chat.

Every quarter, the head of the department hosts lunch to talk to the students. This form of communication is important in keeping everyone up to date with the department, new hires, and keeps the department knowledgeable about any concerns the students have. The Spring lunch is always incredibly fun to attend since we get to hear about the plans for the upcoming year.

The students are great. Sure, you'll get some people who might be super socially awkward or immature, but you'll get that wherever you go. The students here have a variety of personalities and interests (both in and out of the tech field). We have three undergraduate computer labs and an undergraduate hardware lab that many students frequent. Many of the courses are very collaborative; you'll learn how to work with others, which is essential for any real world setting.

Many of the students are very open to meeting new people and working with them. Walk into any lab and do a little "Hey, anyone in 351? I need help understanding bit manipulations!" and someone is bound to wave you over. Many students take part in programming competitions, hackathons (build something cool in 24 hours!), open source, or personal projects. However, we also love hiking, cooking, running, playing frisbee, taking pictures, going to concerts, and playing with nerf guns. A number of students are in the Husky Marching Band or involved with local political campaigns. Our current UW student body president is a CSE/Econ major.

There's a lot of good conversations that come up within the department. These can either be very philosophical, technical, or focus on social issues. We talk about the future of certain technologies, the new CSE building, and outreach to youth (especially minorities and women) in tech/STEM.

A lot of friends first meet in CSE classes or events, and then do things together outside of school. The environment is extremely nurturing, which requires students to be excited to learn, happy to be there, eager to build things, yet humble. Our department would be very different if everyone's ego was severely inflated and everyone treated life like a competition.

We have two undergraduate CSE organizations: ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), and ACM-W, the women focused equivalent (guys welcome!). ACM hosts Research Night, social events, as well as career planning/advice talks and technical workshops/talks. 

### Where do most of the UW CSE students go after graduation?
UW CSE's students are very diverse, so there isn't a straight answer as to where "most" of the students go after graduating.

Approximately a third of the graduates head to one of the big 3: Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. The rest are split somewhat between other established companies, startups, or graduate school/academia. One of our graduates worked with Obama's team to analyze data to see how they should optimize their campaigning resources.

We have an increasing number of students branch out to startups, whether as an early employee or as a founder (e.g. SiftScience). We have a history of more conservative students that go to large companies, although we're actively promoting the startup scene and letting students know that this is an option. One reason why students are typically more conservative is because we have a number of international students who need to get a stable job that provides a work visa/green card to stay in the United States.

A number of students will go pursue a masters or PhD degree. We also have a 5th year BS/MS program where you can finish both your BS and Master's degree in 5 years. You can find more information about that here: http://www.cs.washington.edu/students/bsms/

Since we have such a diverse culture, there isn't any pressure to follow a certain career path after graduation. Nobody looks down at you for not starting a company by the time you're a sophomore in college. Everyone's career paths are celebrated; you're only judged if you don't take advantage of *any* resources here, then complain about it (see: entitlement). I've only know of 2 people who expected to be spoon fed their careers though, and these type of people will exist at any school.

### Scholarship opportunities?
There's a number of scholarships you can apply for. You can find some resources below:

* [CSE](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/ugrad/departmental_scholarships)
* [Department of Engineering](http://www.engr.washington.edu/curr_students/scholarships.html)
* [Honors Program](http://depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/scholarships/current/)
* [UW FAFSA or Academic Scholarships](https://www.washington.edu/students/osfa/ugaid/scholarship.html)

There's also a lot of tech/computer science/STEM/engineering related scholarships out there. These include scholarships sponsored by companies or by different organizations. The scholarships are a mix of financial need based or by academic/merit factors.

### What companies recruit here?
UW CSE has an [Industry Affiliates](http://www.cs.washington.edu/industrial_affiliates/) program, where companies pay a set amount of money for a partnership with the CSE program. One of the benefits is direct recruiting opportunities to the CSE students. You can see a list of [current Affiliates](http://www.cs.washington.edu/industrial_affiliates/current/) online.

UW CSE hosts two Affiliates career/recruiting fairs: one in the Fall and one in the Winter. They span over two days; Tuesdays usually highlight startups while Thursdays are intended for larger/established companies.

As a CSE student, you have access to these career fairs. UW (in general) also hosts career fairs by different groups, including (but not limited to) Science and Engineering, Women in Engineering, and minorities. However, non-CSE students do not have access to CSE only career fairs.

Some companies that recruit engineering students at non-CSE career fairs include (but not limited to): Tesla, Snapchat, Zappos, and Quora.

### How do those companies treat the students?
In my experience, the recruiters treat us very well. They're representing their company, after all. Some recruiters are more personal with the students, but these 'better' recruiters are also employed by some of the more competitive companies. Word gets around really quickly among students (and even to different schools!), so it's honestly in the recruiters' best interests to keep students happy.

Once in a while, you'll run into a recruiter that seems really unprofessional, but you'll probably get that experience at least once no matter what school you go to. It's good learning experience to learn how to deal with difficult people, if you want to spin it that way!

There's also a recruiting policy for the Affiliates program that you can find [here](http://www.cs.washington.edu/industrial_affiliates/recruiting_policy/).
