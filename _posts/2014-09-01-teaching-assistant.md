### Advice from a Graduate TA (Nathaniel Guy)

I've worked as a teaching assistant in UW CSE for three quarters, and they were all quite enjoyable. I'll go over what's required to become a TA, what's expected of TAs, how TAs are compensated, and some advice for becoming a more helpful TA. Note that I only have experience with graduate assistantships; undergraduate assistantships are a different beast altogether.

First of all, becoming a TA for the CSE department isn't all that difficult. If you're already a graduate student in CSE, I believe that you'll be invited to become a TA by the department (and as I understand it, many grad students are guaranteed funding through assistantships). It's still possible to TA in the department even if you're not a grad student in CSE, but it's rare--I've only known three people to do it, including myself. CSE has enough demand for TAs (likely more than any other department) that they can afford to make some non-standard assistantship appointments. If you're a student in another department and you TA for CSE, the CSE department will pay your tuition for the other department; more on that later.

The class assignment for TAs works as follows:  Pim, the TA coordinator for the department, sends out an e-mail just before each quarter asking students interested in TAing to sign up on an online form. At this time, you'll also be given a copy of the proposed class schedule and you'll indicate your preferences for classes and professors to work with.

A few weeks later, you'll be presented with a preliminary list of who's TAing which courses. This is presumably calculated by some super-advanced algorithm optimizing student and professor grad student preferences... but then again, it may just be determined by Pim throwing darts at a wall. It is one of the great mysteries of the department. Either way, if a professor really wants you to TA for them, they can circumvent the PRNG by speaking with Pim beforehand about getting you to TA their class. Typically, it seems that if a TA has TAed a course in the past with a certain professor, they'll be chosen as the TA for that course again by default, unless the student or professor requests a change.

Once assigned a course, the TA(s) for the course will typically reach out to the professor, and will occasionally schedule an initial meeting to talk about student/professor responsibility division for the course. Different professors expect different things from their TAs, but in general, graduate TAs are expected to do the following:

* Plan and teach weekly sections
* Answer e-mails from students
* Monitor and answer student discussion boards
* Hold weekly office hours to help students with projects
* Test and grade student projects (may or may not involve creating rubrics for grading)
* Grade written homework, if applicable
* Design tools or sample code to give to the students to help them with assignments or learning

For newer courses, TAs may even have input into main lecture content, and may be asked to help design or test projects before they're assigned to students. I've been asked to implement projects before they're assigned, in order to make sure that that the specifications are clear, and that the projects are doable without any major snags.

All of this seems like a lot of work, and at times it can be a little overwhelming when combined with a grad student's own coursework and research responsibilities. But it can also be immensely rewarding on a personal level, if you're the sort of person who really likes helping others learn. The compensation offered by the department is also quite generous. In return for teaching, the CSE department provides TAs with a bi-weekly stipend, health insurance, and a complete tuition waiver for classes. It's pretty amazing. The stipend amount varies quarter to quarter, but I hear that CSE offers a higher stipend than the majority of other departments at UW.

Being a good teaching assistant can be difficult, and I can't say that I know all of the secrets to being one--I wish I did! But here are some general guidelines I try to follow as a TA:

* Always answer student e-mails within an hour or two of seeing them. If the student's question is difficult and you can't give a satisfactory response immediately, reply to tell them that you're looking into it and that you'll get back to them soon.
* Never be afraid to say "I don't know." (Never, EVER fake like you know something that you don't.) But don't just leave it at that; look into the problem, preferably along with the student, to show them that you care about answering their questions.
* When planning a lesson, ask yourself if it's interesting, and if it teaches something valuable. Use analogies with memorable imagery, but don't lean so heavily on analogies that you lose sight of the actual topic.
* When teaching a lesson, pause frequently to ask students questions and wait for questions yourself. Most of the time, when students have questions or don't understand something, they'll look puzzled but won't say anything. Try to engage in a simple dialogue to expose those points with which students are having trouble. (This is tough; I'm still working on this.)
* When grading, try to put yourself in the students' places. It's tempting to say stuff like "this code doesn't even compile! What were they thinking?! They deserve an F," and I've even been guilty of such fleeting thoughts. But at the end of the day, a lot of these students are still working really hard and just make honest mistakes sometimes. These mistakes should be addressed, and points should be taken off, sure, but at the end of the day, the important thing is that the students learn to love and understand the material. E-mail students who screw up, and talk to them about it. Encourage them to re-submit. Encourage them to put detail, attention, and care into their projects. Give them extra credit when it's obvious that they're going the extra mile to delve into and appreciate the material.
* Drink beer and listen to good music while grading. It will level your head and reduce the "pissed off" factor you experience when someone's project refuses to work.
* If more than ~20% of people are making the same mistake, then I start to believe that the teaching staff is as much at fault as the students.
* If a student says that they understand something, ask them to explain it to you. This can be a little stressful for them, but if they can't explain it, then they don't really understand it.
* Be friendly and make yourself accessible to students, even outside of section, lecture, and office hours. If a student won't approach you in the lab during off-hours to ask a quick question, it's not as likely they'll approach you during office hours to ask a long one. I tried my best to make friends with the students I TAed, while trying to stay professional so far as the class and grades were concerned.

Hopefully that information all helps aspiring TAs. I highly recommend TAing as a way of getting through grad school. It's immensely enjoyable, personally fulfilling, and can even help you understand the subjects better yourself.
