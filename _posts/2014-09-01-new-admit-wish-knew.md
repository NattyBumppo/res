### Mentorship

### Wish I Knew
Things people wish they knew when they were first admitted into CSE. Brought to you by upperclassmen and recent alumni:

* There's four labs: 002, 003, 006, and 022. Use them!
* Everyone's awesome and nice and helpful, but you have to be brave enough to talk to them to find that out.
* Don't rappel in the CSE building.
* Colloquia is every Thursday. There's snacks and drinks.
* If you see people giving you dirty looks in 002 that means reel it in a bit and shut up for a while.
* Going to the labs with the express intention of *not* getting any work done is often more valuable than going to section. The people you meet in the labs are your professional, academic, and personal network, and you should build that group. 
* Everyone is awesome. I didn't really hang out with anyone in CSE for a couple of quarters, which is unfortunate in retrospect.
* Go to office hours.
* Do research!
* Be wary of [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) and [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).
* Go to ALL of the career fairs!
